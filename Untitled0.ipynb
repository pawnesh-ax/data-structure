This happens in situations where there are hash collisions (i.e., multiple keys are hashed to the same location in the hash table). If a large number of keys end up in the same bucket, the dictionary may need to perform a search through the elements in that bucket to find the correct one. However, this is very unlikely in practice due to Python’s efficient hashing algorithm, and hash tables are generally designed to handle collisions well, keeping the worst-case performance rare."

In earlier versions of Python (before Python 3.7), dictionaries had no inherent order, meaning that the order of key-value pairs was not maintained. Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve insertion order—this means that the order of items in the dictionary will be the same as the order in which they were inserted. However, dictionaries are still technically considered unordered because their main purpose is not to maintain order but to provide efficient key-value lookups.\n",

However, since dictionaries are designed for key-value lookups, order is secondary to the ability to retrieve values efficiently. If you iterate over the dictionary (e.g., using a for loop), the items will be returned in insertion order in Python 3.7+, but in earlier versions, you cannot rely on any order at all."
